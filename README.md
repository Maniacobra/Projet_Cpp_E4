# Introduction
This is the repository related to an **ESIEE** project which aims at programming a game, more precisely a space shooter, using SFML library and **ECS** architecture *(entity component system)*.
# Implemented features
You can directly read the history of the repository to find implemented features. They are listed also below, in the same order as in the assignment:
* Rendering
* Background image display
* Movements
* Scene implementation, scene transition, menu scene
* Tag implementation
* Shooting system, **used by player as well as enemies**
* Missiles shots cooldown (Clock implementation that will be useful for other features too)
* Enemies, enemies spawner system.
* Collision and health management.
* Enemy movements and chasing
* Health bar display.
* Countdown timer and its display.
* Scoring mechanism, score scene, score scene transition.
* Pause/Resume.
* Audio, sound effects and background music. **Note that you need OpenAL32 shared library in the same path as the executable binary**
# Inputs
Use **arrow** keys to move the player, and **E** to shoot enemies.

# Notes
As no bonus is accorded to the gameplay part, the focus isn't on the latter, no complex features nor good balance are implemented.
# Known bugs
No known bugs exist, manual testing was done upon each feature implementation and corresponding bugs were fixed, if you notice any please let us know.
